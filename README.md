Instructions for playing Minesweeper:

1.  The objective of Minesweeper is to uncover all the cells on the grid that do not contain mines without detonating any of the mines.

2.  The game is played on a grid of squares. Each square can either be empty or contain a mine. The size of the grid and the number of mines vary depending on the difficulty level chosen.

3.  Minesweeper offers different difficulty levels:
   - Beginner: 9x9 grid with 10 mines
   - Intermediate: 16x16 grid with 40 mines
   - Expert: 16x30 grid with 99 mines

4. Gameplay:
   - Players can uncover a cell by selecting it.
   - If the selected cell contains a mine, the game ends.
   - If the selected cell does not contain a mine, it reveals a number indicating how many adjacent cells contain mines.
   - Use the revealed numbers to deduce the location of mines and safely uncover empty cells.
   - Players can also flag cells they suspect contain mines to avoid accidentally uncovering them.

5. Commands:
   - Uncover Cell (u): Type `u row col` to uncover the cell at the specified row and column.
   - Flag Cell (f): Type `f row col` to flag the cell at the specified row and column as containing a mine.
   - Delete Flag (d): Type `d row col` to remove the flag from the cell at the specified row and column.

6. The game is won when all non-mine cells are uncovered.

7. The game is lost if a mine is uncovered.

8. The game provides feedback on the number of mines remaining and the time elapsed since the start of the game.

9. Players have the option to restart the game after winning, losing, or whenever they choose.

10. Enjoy the challenge of Minesweeper and have fun strategizing to uncover all the safe cells!
